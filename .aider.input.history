+Code the following app
+```
+A beautiful and fun Duolingo-style language learning mini-app called “Learn Tagalog” that teaches real everyday Tagalog and Bisaya (Cebuano) to English speakers.
+
+On first visit the user chooses either “Tagalog” or “Bisaya” — the entire app (lessons, voice, UI) instantly switches to that language and remembers forever.
+
+The home page shows a short daily lesson (5–10 minutes max) with these question types that appear one after another:
+- Translate the sentence (English ↔ Filipino)
+- Multiple choice
+- Tap the picture that matches the word shown
+- Flip-card: tap a card with a photo → it flips to reveal the Tagalog/Bisaya word
+- Speak the sentence (uses Web Speech API)
+- Type what you hear
+- Fill in the blank
+
+Use only real-life conversational sentences (greetings, food, jeepney, market, family, flirting, directions, etc.).
+
+Background is a smooth Philippine flag gradient: orange → yellow → red. Buttons are bright blue and white. Title is “Learn Tagalog” with a big Philippine flag emoji.
+
+On the title/home screen, generate and display a majestic Philippine eagle mascot using Stable Diffusion with this exact prompt:  
+“majestic Philippine eagle, powerful and proud, piercing golden eyes, dramatic lighting, subtle Philippine flag colors in feathers, ultra-realistic cinematic style, extreme detail, patriotic and inspiring, 8k”  
+→ save as eagle.png and show large on the home screen.
+
+5-heart system, daily streak, and XP counter at the top. When lesson finishes → fireworks + confetti + “Share on Farcaster/X” button.
+
+All progress, chosen language, and streak saved to /var/lib/mini-app/progress.json (add StateDirectory = "mini-app"; in the NixOS module).
+
+Everything in pure HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript only. Place the entire learning experience directly on the home page.
+
+Mabuhay!
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

+All I see is this at the bottom. "Daily lesson will appear here." but no lesson. I also see a Streak of 7, but i have never played before so I dont think this works either. Please fix both issues.
